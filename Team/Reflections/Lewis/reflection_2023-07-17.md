## 2023-07-17 - Reflection

During the summer I've been working on a mobile application using Flutter Project with Andrew - an Instagram Clone which you can view here - https://github.com/LewisBrogan/instagram-clone/tree/dev / https://github.com/AndrewEllen/instagram-clone. As a beginner in the Flutter framework I faced some initial challenges at the start while I got use to it, so Andrew mentored me on some the issues I was having. We decided on doing this project successfully and adopted agile principles within our non-agile project enviroment.  (Arun, What is Agile: Understanding Agile Methodology and principles 2023)

I was a bit skeptical at first using Flutter due to how new the framework was. However, I was also excited about learning something completely new and after some research Flutter seemed like a really good idea for application development. This project, with a new framework, we decided would be a good way to apply the principles of Agile to improve our project management process and hit the Learning Outcomes we need.

incorporating daily standups and weekly updates(when possible) proved to be beneficial for our project, and for my learning. The daily standups helped us align our tasks and progress, identify and address blockers, and supported effective communication within our small team of 2. The non Agile environment recognized the value of these daily stand-ups.

The weekly updates and demos served as opportunities for us to showcase our progress, gather valuable feedback, and ensure alignment with the backlog. These sessions also helped us identify areas for improvement and asign tasks accordingly for how long they would take.

By applying Agile principles to our Flutter project, we were able to mitigate the challenges associated with my limited experience in Flutter development. Daily morning standups allowed us to share knowledge, code review, and support each other. The iterative approach and frequent interactions enabled us to provide feedback early on and make necessary adjustments, ensuring the project was on the right track and no unneccersary blockers or delays happened.

Through our commitment to Agile principles, we were able to navigate the complexities of the Flutter project more effectively, despite my limited experience. The incorporation of Agile practices helped with communication, collaboration, and support, leading to a more effective project.

Overall, this experience taught me the importance of flexibility, communication, and iterative development in managing projects effectively. I gained a deeper understanding of the Agile philosophy and its practical application, even in a non agile environment. This project highlights the significance of continuous learning and adaptation, allowing us to deliver a successful Flutter application while sticking to agile principles.

We used Trello -> Clickup for our Kanban board.

To summarize the agile principles we adopted in the project:

- Daily morning standups
- Iterative development approach
- Weekly updates and demos
- Adopting change and adaptation based on feedback
- Collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Prioritized delivering incremental versions of the application
